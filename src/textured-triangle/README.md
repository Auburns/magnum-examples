This example is just slightly more complicated version of the basic triangle
example. It uses a TGA importer plugin to load a stone image and displays a
triangle with texture on it.

Documentation, ports, live web version
--------------------------------------

This example is thoroughly explained in the documentation, which you can read
online at http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/examples-textured-triangle.html .
There's also a live web version at http://magnum.graphics/showcase/textured-triangle/ .
The [ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports/src/textured-triangle)
contains additional patches for iOS, Android and Emscripten support that aren't
present in `master` in order to keep the example code as simple as possible.
