Documentation, ports, live web version
--------------------------------------

This example is thoroughly explained in the documentation, which you can read
online at http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/examples-primitives.html . There's
also a live web version at http://magnum.graphics/showcase/primitives/ . The
[ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports/src/primitives)
contains additional patches for iOS, Android and Emscripten support that aren't
present in `master` in order to keep the example code as simple as possible.
