into Magnum.

Usage
-----

This example requires you to have the Oculus Runtime 1.3.0 or newer installed.
Since Oculus only supports Windows, the same holds for the example. If you
don't own a HMD, you can still try the example. If no device is connected, it
will create a debug HMD instead.

Key controls
------------

-   **F11** -- toggle performance HUD
-   **F12** -- toggle stereo debug HUD
-   **M** -- toggle mirroring
-   **Escape** -- close the application
