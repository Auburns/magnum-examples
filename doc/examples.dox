@brief Learn by examples to get started as soon as possible.

The examples assume that you have at least basic knowledge about graphics
(what are homogeneous coordinates, what is mesh, vertex, texture...), how
OpenGL works (what are buffers, what is depth test for...) and basics of GLSL
(attributes, uniforms, vertex/fragment shaders...). Knowledge of OpenGL API
itself is not required, as Magnum wraps the functionality in its own classes.

Full source code for all examples is available also in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples).
