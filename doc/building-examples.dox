@brief Guide how to download and build examples for Magnum engine.

@tableofcontents

Examples demonstrate Magnum features, usage and capabilities. They are not
needed for essential usage, but are useful for learning purposes in addition to
the documentation itself.

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples.
Building integration libraries is very similar to building Magnum itself. See
@ref building for additonal information about building, crosscompiling and
platform-specific issues.

By default only *Triangle* example is built. Some examples depend on plugins
and integration libraries, see @ref building-plugins and @ref building-integration
for more information.

-   `WITH_AUDIO_EXAMPLE` -- Build Audio example. Requires @ref Audio library
    and @ref Audio::WavImporter "WavAudioImporter" plugin.
-   `WITH_BULLET_EXAMPLE` -- Build Bullet example. Requires @ref BulletIntegration
    library.
-   `WITH_CUBEMAP_EXAMPLE` -- Build Cube Map example. Requires
    @ref Trade::JpegImporter "JpegImporter" plugin, not available in OpenGL ES.
-   `WITH_MOTIONBLUR_EXAMPLE` -- Build Motion Blur example. Not available on
    OpenGL ES.
-   `WITH_OVR_EXAMPLE` -- Build Oculus VR example. Requires @ref OvrIntegration
    library.
-   `WITH_PICKING_EXAMPLE` -- Build Object Picking example.
-   `WITH_PRIMITIVES_EXAMPLE` -- Build @ref examples-primitives "Primitives" example.
-   `WITH_SHADOWS_EXAMPLE` -- Build Shadows example.
-   `WITH_TEXT_EXAMPLE` -- Build Text example. Requires @ref Text::FreeTypeFont "FreeTypeFont"
    plugin.
-   `WITH_TEXTUREDTRIANGLE_EXAMPLE` -- Build @ref examples-textured-triangle "Textured Triangle"
    example. Requires @ref Trade::JpegImporter "JpegImporter" plugin, not
    available in OpenGL ES.
-   `WITH_TRIANGLE_EXAMPLE` -- Build @ref examples-triangle "Triangle" example.
-   `WITH_VIEWER_EXAMPLE` -- Build @ref examples-viewer "Viewer" example.
    Requires @ref Trade::AnySceneImporter "AnySceneImporter" plugin.

@section building-examples-arch Building ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux` directory is currently one package for Git development
build. The package is also in AUR under the same name.

There are also a few development PKGBUILDs in `package/archlinux`, which allow
you to build and install the package directly from source tree without
downloading anything.

@section building-examples-gentoo Gentoo ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in `package/gentoo` directory.

@section building-examples-deb Building DEB packages

There is also `package/debian/` directory with all files needed for building
Debian packages. You need to have `corrade-dev`, `magnum-dev`,
`magnum-integration-dev` and `magnum-plugins-dev` DEB packages installed and in
addition also `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages. Building is easy, just
change directory to package root, link or copy `package/debian` directory there
and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

    ln -s package/debian .
    dpkg-buildpackage

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in
parent directory. If you need to modify CMake flags (enabling/disabling some
examples, for example), modify the last entry in `debian/rules`.

@subsection building-examples-brew Homebrew formulas

macOS Homebrew formulas are in `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the
`*.rb` files directly or use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum:

    brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-examples

@section building-examples-ci Continuous Integration

@subsection building-examples-ci-travis Travis

In `package/ci/` there is a `travis.yml` file with Linux GCC 4.7, macOS Clang,
Linux desktop GLES2/GLES3, iOS GLES2/GLES3, Emscripten WebGL1/WebGL2 and
Android GLES2/GLES3 configuration. Online at https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum-examples.

@subsection building-examples-ci-appveyor AppVeyor

In `package/ci/` there is an `appveyor.yml` file with Windows desktop MSVC,
MinGW, Windows desktop GLES2/GLES3 and Windows RT GLES2/GLES3 configuration.
Online at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mosra/magnum-examples.
